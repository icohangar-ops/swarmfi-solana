"""
Calibration feedback loop for swarm reputation weights (propagation row 4).

Origin: pythia's engine.py calibration loop (Brier score -> softmax weights
between rounds). This port adapts the loop to continuous price consensus:
agents submit price *values*, not probabilities, so the Brier score's
continuous analog (squared error against the realized price) drives the
update, and reputation weights are recomputed between rounds via a softmax
over negative error.

Design constraints, inherited from the origin and the portfolio's
deterministic-learner discipline:

- **Bounded updates.** A single round can never flip a reputation: the new
  value is a convex blend of the old reputation and the round's softmax
  score (learning rate <= 0.5), clamped to [min_reputation, 1.0]. A noisy
  or adversarial round nudges; it does not capture.
- **Pure functions.** Scoring and updating are pure and unit-testable;
  the orchestrator only applies the returned values.
- **Honest provenance.** The realized price for round N is proxied by
  round N+1's consensus value until an external resolution price is
  available (market resolution or an oracle feed) — `resolve_price` can be
  passed directly and takes precedence. The proxy is recorded in the
  outcome log so a future external price feed can replay and supersede it.

Wiring: the orchestrator calls `CalibrationLoop.on_consensus(result)` each
round; it scores the previous round's submissions against the new consensus
value and applies bounded reputation updates through the agent manager.
